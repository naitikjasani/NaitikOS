/**
 * @naitikos/core — the durable layer.
 *
 * Blueprint §5.0:
 *
 *   "Domain logic must be able to compile and run with zero framework imports.
 *    ...it is the only part of the system intended to survive two decades."
 *
 * The framework ban is enforced mechanically by `boundaries/external`
 * (packages/config/eslint/boundaries.js) and, before that, by this package's
 * package.json simply not declaring React, Next, Drizzle, or Supabase.
 *
 * Subdirectories are populated per the roadmap (§12). Each carries a README
 * stating what it owns.
